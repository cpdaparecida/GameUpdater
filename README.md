# GameUpdater
A simple game patch creator and launcher.

This is a VS2019 C# project.

The GameUpdater connects to an FTP server and downloads updates.

On the FTP Server you have to provide the update zip archives that are generated by the GamePatchCreator application.

The FTP server address, user login and game startup executable you have to enter in the Settings.cs file from the GameUpdater project. 

You have to provide a file named versions.txt on the FTP Directory that lists the version numbers of the game.

Example content of versions.txt:

```
0.0.2
0.0.10
0.0.23
1.0.0
```

For each version in the versions.txt except the first entry you have to provide an update zip archive in the same directory as "versions.txt".

These update archives has to named like the version with a ".zip" file extension.

Example:
```
0.0.10.zip
0.0.23.zip
1.0.0.zip
```
